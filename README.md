I'm Salar. A python/Django programmer from Iran.
I've always been a tech enthusiast ever since I was a 7 years old and been able to install Max Payne on my computer.
I'm fascinated by programming and all of its challenges.
I'm studying dentistry in Hamedan university of medical sciences but that doesn't stop me from pursuing my passion, programming.
